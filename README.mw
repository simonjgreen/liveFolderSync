==Setting up liveFolderSync==
The following instructions apply to Ubuntu, I've not tested elsewhere. 
# Checkout the latest copy of liveFolderSync to somewhere on your server, eg /usr/local/liveFolderSync
# Symlink /usr/local/liveFolderSync to /usr/sbin/liveFolderSync
# Symlink /usr/local/defaults to /etc/defaults/liveFolderSync
# Symlink /usr/local/init to /etc/init.d/liveFolderSync
# Configure your user, base path and destination server in /etc/defaults/liveFolderSync
## Be sure the user you use has read permission on the basedir and has a shared SSH key between the servers
# Start the daemon with /etc/init.d/liveFolderSync
# ?
# Profit
